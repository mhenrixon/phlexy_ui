A Ruby UI component library for DaisyUI using Phlex

# Installation

## 1. Install CSS dependencies

You can install TailwindCSS and DaisyUI either via a JS bundler or via importmaps.

### JS Bundler

**TailwindCSS**

Install TailwindCSS by following the instructions in the TailwindCSS documentation, using either the Tailwind CLI or PostCSS.

**DaisyUI**

Install DaisyUI by following the instructions in the DaisyUI documentation as a Node package.

### Importmaps

**TailwindCSS with DaisyUI**

You'll need to download a TailwindCSS standalone CLI that comes bundled with DaisyUI by following the instructions in the [tailwind-cli-extra repo](https://github.com/dobicinaitis/tailwind-cli-extra).

Afterwards, place it somewhere in your project, e.g. in the bin directory.

If you want to compile the standalone TailwindCSS CLI with DaisyUI yourself, you can follow the instructions here.

**tailwindcss-rails gem**

Install tailwindcss-rails gem for Rails to automatically include your TailwindCSS stylesheets when the asset pipeline compiles your assets.

For this, you'll need to install the gem by following the instructions in the [tailwindcss-rails repo](https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails).

Finally, you'll need to set the `TAILWINDCSS_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable in your Rails app pointing to the directory where you placed the binary from the tailwind-cli-extra repo mentioned above. e.g. `TAILWINDCSS_INSTALL_DIR=bin`

## 2. Install Ruby dependencies

### Install Phlex

Install Phlex by following the instructions in the [Phlex documentation](https://www.phlex.fun/#rails-introduction).

### Install DaisyUI gem

1. Add the DaisyUI gem to your Gemfile:

```
bundle add daisyui
```

2. (Optional) Include the `DaisyUI` module in `ApplicationComponent`:

```rb
class ApplicationComponent < Phlex::HTML
  include DaisyUI
end
```

This will allow you to use DaisyUI components using the short-form syntax. For example:

```rb
class SomeView < ApplicationView
  def view_template
    Button :primary do
      "Hello, world!"
    end
  end
end
```

If you don't include DaisyUI, you can still use the namespaced syntax:

```rb
class SomeView < ApplicationView
  def view_template
    render DaisyUI::Button.new(:primary) do
      "Hello, world!"
    end
  end
end
```

Consider not including DaisyUI in ApplicationComponent if:

- You have your own component library with the same component names as DaisyUI.
- You're including your own components module in `ApplicationComponent`.

In this scenario, including both DaisyUI and your own component library in `ApplicationComponent` will lead to naming conflicts.

3. Update your `tailwind.config.js` file to include DaisyUI component styles:

```js
const execSync = require("child_process").execSync;
const outputDaisyUI = execSync("bundle show daisyui", { encoding: "utf-8" });
const daisyUIPath = outputDaisyUI.trim() + "/**/*.rb";
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ... other paths
    daisyUIPath,
  ],
};
```

4. Update your tailwind.config.js file to detect TailwindCSS classes in Ruby files.

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ... other paths
    //
    // Note the "rb" extension at the end
    "./app/views/**/*.{erb,haml,html,slim,rb}",
  ],
};
```

# Compatibility Notes

## @tailwindcss/forms plugin

If you're using the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin alongside DaisyUI, you may encounter styling conflicts with form components like Toggle, Checkbox, and Radio. The forms plugin adds default checkbox/radio styling that can interfere with DaisyUI's custom styling.

**Solution:** Add the following CSS to your stylesheet to override the forms plugin styling for DaisyUI components:

```css
/* Override @tailwindcss/forms checkbox styles for DaisyUI components */
.toggle,
.checkbox,
.radio {
  background-image: none !important;
}
.toggle:checked,
.checkbox:checked,
.radio:checked {
  background-image: none !important;
}
```

Alternatively, you can configure `@tailwindcss/forms` to use the `class` strategy instead of `base`, which only applies styles when you explicitly add form classes:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
plugins: [
  require('@tailwindcss/forms')({
    strategy: 'class', // only apply form styles to elements with form-* classes
  }),
],
```

# Usage

Refer to [the docs](https://daisyui.phlex.fun) to see how to use components. Here's an example:

```rb
Card :base_100 do |card|
  figure do
    img(src:)
  end
  card.body do
    card.title do
      "Shoes!"
    end
    p do
      "If a dog chews shoes whose shoes does he choose?"
    end
    card.actions class: "justify-end" do
      Button :primary do
        "Buy Now"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Which produces:
